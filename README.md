<h3>Project 1 : Binary to decimal converter</h3> <br>
This project is a binary to decimal converter. It converts a valid binary number to a decimal number. I have used conditional statements to make sure the input is a valid binary number.
<h3>Project 2 : Text encoder</h3><br>

This is a text encoder programme that takes text as input and returns a binary version of the text. It uses python's built in module ``regx`` . Actually it considers an alphabet as a number according to its sequence and converts the number to binary. Then it joins each number and makes a word. Alphabets are separated by one dot and words are separated by two dots. Also, sentences are separated by a "|" sign.
