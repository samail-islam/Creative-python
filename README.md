<h3>ðŸ›  Project 1 : Binary to decimal converter</h3> <br>
This project is a binary to decimal converter. It converts a valid binary number to a decimal number. I have used conditional statements to make sure the input is a valid binary number.
<h3>ðŸ›  Project 2 : Text encoder</h3><br>

This is a text encoder programme that takes text as input and returns a binary version of the text. It uses python's built in module ``regex`` . Actually it considers an alphabet as a number according to its sequence and converts the number to binary. Then it joins each number and makes a word. Alphabets are separated by one dot and words are separated by two dots. Also, sentences are separated by a "|" sign.

If you're looking for a repository to make your first contribution, this would be a great choice. This repository contains unique python projects instead of typical projects like tic tac to, dice rolling game ect.<br>
<br>

<p>To contribute, you just need to do the following steps:<br>
<br>

<b>1.</b> Fork this repository using the fork button. <br>

<b>2.</b> Add your creative project with description and commit changes. <br>

<b>3.</b> Come to this repository and go to pull requests, click the ``new`` button.

<b>4.</b> Then click `compare across forks` link above. 

<b>5.</b> Select this repository as `base` and your forked repository as `head` to compare.

> if you want to do this using git from your local machine, then clone your forked repository using ``git clone`` command. Then add your project and push changes to github. Then come to your forked repo on github, you would find a ``compare and pull request`` button. Use that and then follow the 6th step above.

If you're a newcomer or an intermediate python programmer looking for project to contribute, contributing to this repository would be a great start.
